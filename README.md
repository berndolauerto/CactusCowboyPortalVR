Cactus Cowboy is back in Cactus Cowboy Portal VR!



You're the Cactus Cowboy trying to escape out of the cacti labs with your portal revolvers while being tortured by something evil.

6DoF Jump'n'Run / FPS Adventure containing:

* Full Locomotion and nothing else
* Dual wielding Portalrevolvers
* Cacticubes
* Bombs
* Bossfights
* Deep falls and long jumps
* Portal based riddles
* GLADOS voice by https://15.ai
* Chiptune Soundtrack made by Trackerbernd

Yes, this is a Portalstyled VR Game. A content of questionable quality production by me presents you what no one seems to make. Portals, full locomotion and jumping. This is not for greenhorns!

Playtime: About 1-3h depending on your skill 
**Warning: No comfort options and I'm certainly not going to make one. I can't really judge how hard this is on your stomach. Rule of thumb: If you can handle Boneworks you can handle this.

This is freeware. Assets are either made by myself, public domain or creative commons. So this is my 2nd VR and Unity game, so please be a wee bit considerate in your reviews

Note: PCVR Version coming soon
